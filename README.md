As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria.
Then I will be able to create a strong password that provides greater security.

This app creates a randomly generated password based on the credentials provided. You have the option of choosing between 8 and 128 characters, whether or not to add uppercased letters, whether or not to add numbers, and whether or not to add symbols.
